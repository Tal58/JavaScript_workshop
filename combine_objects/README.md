# Combine Object

Your task is to write a function that takes two or more objects and returns a new object which combines all the input objects.

# Learning Outcomes

Aim of this challenge is as follows;

 -analyze a problem, identify and apply programming knowledge for appropriate solution.<br>
 -demonstrate their knowledge of algorithmic design principles by using JavaScript effectively.<br>
 
# Problem Statement
All input object properties will have only numeric values. Objects are combined together so that the values of matching keys are added together.

<br>
Expected Outcome<br>
An example:<br>
const objA = { a: 10, b: 20, c: 30 }<br>
const objB = { a: 3, c: 6, d: 3 }<br>
const objC = { a: 5, d: 11, e: 8 }<br>
const objD = { c: 3 }<br>

combine(objA, objB) // Returns { a: 13, b: 20, c: 36, d: 3 }<br>
