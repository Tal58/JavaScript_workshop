Merge Arrays

Purpose of the this coding challenge is to write a code that given two sorted arrays, returns merged array of these inputs.

For example:

```javascript
A = [12, 14, 16]; 
B = [11, 13, 17];
expectedOutput = [11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17];
```

## Learning Outcomes

Aim of this challenge are as follows;

- Analyze a problem, identify and apply programming knowledge for appropriate solution.

- Demonstrate their knowledge of algorithmic design principles by using JavaScript effectively.

## Problem Statement

- Write a function that takes two arrays of sorted numbers and combines them into one array as result.

- Please note that, **empty arrays** to be checked to avoid exception!

For example:

```javascript
A = []; 
B = [11, 13, 17];
expectedOutput = [11, 13, 17];
```
