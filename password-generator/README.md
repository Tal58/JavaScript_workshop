as default and expected constraints below.

# Learning Outcomes

Aim of this challenge is as follows;

 -analyze a problem, identify and apply programming knowledge for appropriate solution.<br>
 -demonstrate their knowledge of algorithmic design principles by using JavaScript effectively.<br>
 
# Problem Statement
